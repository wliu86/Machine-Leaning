# Machine-Leaning
 Basic concepts of machine learning,  both supervised and unsupervised, as well as the basic ideas of neural networks 

In ad click prediction project, two datasets are given: a labled training set(which contains roughly 30 million records), and a test set(13 million records) with no lables. After exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, I extracted several subsets from the original training data for training and validation purpose, and made predictions over the test sets.
